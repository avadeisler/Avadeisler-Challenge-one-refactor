# Challenge-one

In this challenge we were supposed to chenge starter code to match the example in the module. Here are the changes I made to reach this goal.

I changed the css link so that it worked properly.
I added the hero image and did an image wrap in the hero section.
 I also changed the size of the actual image so that it didn't show up too large.
I changed the font in the section boxes (on line 50) so that they would appear the same.
I also added a display-inline to the header so that all of the text would be on the same line.
I changed the height and the margins of the "Benefits" section to make it more similar to the example.
I removed the text in the footer.

I Am pushing it to git hub and deploying it as per the requirements of the challenge.
