# Challenge-one

In this challenge we were supposed to chenge starter code to match the example in the module. Here are the changes I made to reach this goal.

I changed the css link so that it worked properly.
I added the hero image and did an image wrap in the hero section.
I changed the font in the section boxes (on line 50) so that they would appear the same.
I also added a display-inline to the header so that all of the text would be on the same line.
I changed the height and the margins of the "Benefits" section to make it more similar to the example.
I removed the text in the footer.
I added an id for the search engine optimization to make the link clickable.

I faced challenges with getting the hero image to show up properly but eventually got it.
I also need to brush up on the correct order of CSS and how to properly clean it up. I am worried about putting something in the wrong order and screwing up the code.

I Am pushing it to git hub and deploying it as per the requirements of the challenge.
Here is a screenshot of the completed web page.
